//
// Backend FACTORIES — the single-source declarations of how a ComputeBackend is
// constructed (cleanup X-9/B8; architecture.md §8 DRY single-home, §9 Resources).
//
// THIS HEADER IS CUDA-FREE BY CONTRACT, like device/backend.hpp itself: it names
// only the CUDA-free `ComputeBackend` interface and `std::unique_ptr`, so `core`,
// the CLI, and the tests can construct either backend without pulling in the CUDA
// toolkit (CUDA is PRIVATE to steppe_device; architecture.md §4). A backend's
// CONSTRUCTION is part of its public contract and belongs next to the interface,
// not hand-declared at each call site — before this header every consumer (the
// reference tests + the M4.5 `Resources` wiring) forward-declared the factory
// prototype itself, in two different namespaces, so a signature change silently
// broke linkage/ODR with no single source (cleanup X-9/B8; device-backend §9.1).
//
// NAMESPACE: both factory DECLARATIONS live in `namespace steppe::device`.
// `make_cuda_backend` always did (cuda_backend.cu); the `make_cpu_backend` FACTORY
// was MOVED here from `steppe::core`. Only the factory function is declared here —
// the concrete `CpuBackend` class itself is NOT named in this header; it remains a
// private implementation detail of its own TU (cpu_backend.cpp). Both backends always
// compiled into steppe_device, so the old `steppe::core` placement of the cpu factory
// was a namespace/layer mismatch, now resolved: the two factories of ONE interface
// share ONE namespace. Both still return the abstract `ComputeBackend` so callers
// never name the concrete type.
